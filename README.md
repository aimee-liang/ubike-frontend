### Origins
This project was born out of a personal necessity. In 2020, I spent hours on Google Maps trying to figure out the best routes to bike in New York City, as well as available bike racks near where I'd be heading. That was pretty frustrating, especially when I would arrive not knowing if they would all be occupied and I'd be forced to walk a few blocks over to find another bike rack. Even then, I was nervous about leaving my bike out for too long because I didn't want my bike to get stolen. Then I realized how other riders might feel the same way. People are hesistant to ride the subway (as I made this project, we're in COVID times), but biking offers its own unique issues.

Enter, ubike (no relation to any other apps). ubike offers a way to allow users to check in/out of bike parking shelters throughout New York City (all five boroughs). It also allows riders to filter for shelters depending on the borough and for riders to leave comments and reviews. 

### Main API
This app was made possible by the NYC Open Data API. I used the [Bike Shelters](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bicycle-Parking-Shelters/thbt-gfu9) information. 

### Map API
This map was made possible by React Map GL API. You can access their documentation [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to get an access token as well as learn more about how to implement styles. I would like to thank [Dallas Bille](https://medium.com/swlh/getting-started-with-react-and-mapbox-gl-js-daa96477dd2c) and their super helpful Medium article on how to implement a responsive map feature. [Celeste Layne](https://www.celestelayne.com/blog) has a three blog series on Mapbox which was very enlightening.

### Stretch Goals
The next version would include a map safety feature, being able to interact with other users, and either transitioning this or having a separate version in React Native as users would be on the go when biking.
